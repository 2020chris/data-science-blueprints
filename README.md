# Data science blueprints

This repository contains end-to-end examples of accelerated machine learning systems.  

The first such example presents [modeling customer churn](./churn), from federating data and performing exploratory query-based analytics to feature engineering, model training, and model operationalization.  The data engineering portions of the blueprint are accelerated with the RAPIDS Accelerator for Apache Spark and the machine learning portions are accelerated with the RAPIDS Python libraries.  To learn more about this blueprint and these technologies, you can read [our ebook](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai-data-science/resources/churn-prediction-blueprint/).
